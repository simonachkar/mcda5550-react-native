> ðŸ“± Camera App + Database

React Native provides many ways to store data locally on the device, one of them is by using SQLite. SQLite is a popular, lightweight, and open-source relational database management system.

There are many libraries used in React Native to store data on the device  with SQLite. In this lecture we are using `expo-sqlite`.

Keep in mind that `expo-sqlite` does not work on web.
