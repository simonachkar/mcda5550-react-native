# Using the device's Camera and Media Library ðŸ“¸

This app is a practical example of how to use the device's camera and media library in React Native. It allows users to take pictures, save them to their device, and view their saved photos in a gallery. The app utilizes `expo-camera` for camera access, `expo-media-library` for saving and retrieving images, and `expo-sqlite` for local data persistence.

## Features

- **Take Photos**: Use your device's camera to capture pictures.
- **Save Photos**: Keep your photos by saving them directly to your device's gallery.
- **Photo Gallery**: Browse through your saved photos within the app.
- **SQLite Database**: Manages saved photos metadata for easy access and organization.

## Getting Started

To run the Camera App, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
1. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
1. Start the app with `npx expo start` or `npm start`

## Technologies Used

### Expo Camera

The `expo-camera` library provides a React Native component that wraps the camera on your device, allowing you to take photos and videos, as well as perform operations such as zoom, focus, flip camera, etc.

> Note: The `expo-camera` does not work in emulators.

### Expo MediaLibrary

The `expo-media-library` library provides access to the media library on the device. With this library, you can access the photos and videos saved on the device and perform actions such as saving new photos and videos or deleting existing ones.
