# Introduction to React Native ⚛️

React Native is a framework enabling developers to build mobile apps using JavaScript and React. It provides a native-like experience on both Android and iOS with a single codebase.

## Create a React Native Project

You can use either Expo CLI or React Native CLI to create a project. For Expo CLI:

```bash
npx create-expo-app project-name

cd project-name
npx expo start
```

### Expo

Expo is a development platform that simplifies building, testing, and deploying mobile apps.

### More info

For more info on setting up the development environment, refer to [React Native's environment setup doc](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
